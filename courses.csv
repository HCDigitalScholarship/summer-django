Life throughout much of the world today is saturated by forms of media and media technologies: films, television, radio, cell phones, the internet and social media. This course examines media from an anthropological perspective, focusing on the impact of these various non-print media on social and political life. We will also explore the distinctive properties of two media phenomena specific to our time: reality TV and social media. Throughout, we will be concerned with the constitutive power of media at two levels: first, in the construction of subjectivity, senses of self, and the production of affect; and second, in collective social and political projects, such as building national identity, consolidating or resisting state power, giving voice to indigenous claims, or creating alliances.

This course provides a comprehensive review of the order Primates, focusing on morphology, biological adaptations, and behavioral diversity characterizing non-human primates. First, we will investigate the morphological traits that characterize major primate groups, and their evolutionary history. As many primate taxa are endangered or vulnerable to extinction, we will explore the approaches and challenges to primate conservation. In the second half of the course, we will focus on primate socioecology, examining how different environments influence primate distribution and social relationships. We will then delve further into primate behavior and cognition, examining interpersonal relationships, social dynamics, communication strategies, and learning modes. In doing this, we will address the questions concerning the recognition and definition of culture, self-awareness, and personhood among non-human primates using a comparative perspective.

A consideration of the history of anthropological theories and the discipline of anthropology as an academic discipline that seeks to understand and explain society and culture as its subjects of study. Several vantage points on the history of anthropological theory are engaged to enact an historically charged anthropology of a disciplinary history. Anthropological theories are considered not only as a series of models, paradigms, or orientations, but as configurations of thought, technique, knowledge, and power that reflect the ever-changing relationships among the societies and cultures of the world. This course qualifies as completion of the writing requirement.  Prerequisite: ANTH B102/ANTH H103 and at least one additional anthropology course at the 200 or 300 level.

The countries of South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka) have produced vibrant and varied forms of popular culture, including cinema, theatrical and other forms of performance, and sonic and visual culture. Using cinema and other audio-visual materials, this course will examine media and performance as crucial sites for the construction and negotiation of gender ideologies and hierarchies in these different national contexts. The issues we will explore include: questions of agency, constraint, and identity in performance; the role of mass mediation in creating new masculinities and femininities; and the relationship between popular culture and larger sociopolitical identities.

Borders are often taken for granted as natural divisions in the world, but they are actually the products of political, historical, and social processes. Border crossing is often framed as an aberration or even a crisis, but people have moved for as long as humans have existed. How do we make sense of these contradictions? How do borders give meaning to movement? How do people who move—or, who desire to move—engage, evade, or make use of borders? This course approaches borders from an anthropological perspective by foregrounding the experiences of the people who move across them. Focusing on specific instances of mobility in their sociocultural contexts, we will investigate moving and belonging across borders from the viewpoints of people variously categorized as migrants and refugees, giving particular attention to how these categories take on meaning in everyday life. From here, we will consider how broader issues of state power and sovereignty, belonging and exclusion, and global inequality intersect with the movements of people around the world.; Current topic description: Borders are often taken for granted as natural divisions in the world, but they are actually the products of political, historical, and social processes.

Program. 4 seats for Anthropology major at Bryn Mawr. Throughout human
history, diverse peoples have been interacting with each other and
their environment on the borderlands--places shaped by encounters
across difference, with significant implications on culture and
livelihood.  This cluster focuses on the core issue of borderland
encounters, and addresses a variety of common themes such as the
concept and nature of borderlands, cultural exchange, power relations,
ethnic experience, human- environmental interactions, and
(trans)nationalism. The field study will explore the borderlands along
China’s Southwest Silk Road through Yunnan province, which encompass
diverse ethnic cultures such as Tibetans and Thai in Shangri-La and
Xishuangbanna and borderlands environmental experiences along the
Tea-Horse trading route. If you are interested in the 360 program, you

This dance and movement composition course is open to movers of any kind, from any background, who want to explore embodied creation as a part of their educational and/or life practice. It engages students in developing and structuring movement ideas to build community with one another and the natural environment. This course will offer tools for developing creative problem solving skills; exploring embodied approaches to observation, analysis, and communication; and investigating possibilities for collaboration. Students will be introduced to freestyle, cultural narratives, memoir, and other resources relevant to our social climate as tools for researching and sketching choreographic ideas. Movement exercises, viewing of live and filmed work, and discussions will help to sharpen visual analysis and kinesthetic responses. The course includes journaling and required readings and viewings, but focuses primarily on weekly movement assignments. The processes explored in this course encourage students to cultivate the awareness and intention necessary to create and perform individual and collective works as a way of communicating ideas through the moving body. ARTD B144 Dance Composition: Elements and Craft is offered in the spring. ARTD B142 and ARTD B144 are not sequential and may be taken in any order. Concurrent participation in at least one class session per week in any level Dance Program technique course, either for credit or as an auditor, is recommended.

This course is a practical introduction to Screendance for students interested in extending their experience or interest in dance and movement into a new realm. Also known as dancefilm, cinedance, videodance and/or dance for the camera, Screendance connects film (and filmmaking) with dance (and dancemaking) in an evolving hybrid performative practice. For both the maker and audience, the inquiry is the adventure of discovering what the coming together of dance and screen can be. Screendance can be described as diverse, global, emergent, alive, active, trans-media, continually evolving. Through class screenings, exercises, readings and discussion, students will learn approaches to combining dance and the moving image. Students will work alone and in small collaborative groups to create their own works integrating dance and video. Through creative projects, students will develop their own cinematic style and an increased proficiency with both filming and editing movement.

This dance theory, writing, and practice course takes marronage—the act of escaping from slavery in the Americas to create autonomous communities—as its model. It views Black and African diasporic movement cultures and artistic practices as forms of contemporary marronage, providing spaces of embodied activism, release, restoration, and revival towards thriving. Students will engage the body as an individual, intimate maroon site and cultivate the embodied collective spaces that counter oppressive systems. By connecting theory and practice, students will build individual and collective consciousness through the resources of narrative, memoir, and nostalgia intertwined with guided movement sessions. We will also utilize creative writing, film, and visual arts as components that enhance potential for deeper embodied engagement. This course is writing attentive and has required movement assignments/presentations. A previous dance lecture/seminar course or a course in a relevant discipline such as anthropology, sociology, or history is strongly recommended but not required. No dance experience is necessary, however a willingness to move and create is essential.

Over the semester, the student will attend all auditions, rehearsals, and performances of the Bi-College Theater Program production, and will be responsible for managing all the details of same. With the guidance of a mentor and through reading and research, the student will learn to perform the many organizational and communications tasks involved in stage management. Students will be required to read a number of texts with the goal of understanding the vast scope of the job, the artistry and authority expected of a stage manager, the variations in styles of stage management, and the standard procedures a student stage manager can incorporate into a college setting. Each student will be expected to keep a daily journal of their experience—intellectual, artistic, and practical. The journal is their own and is meant to stimulate and deepen their thinking about the process. This practicum requires that a student be willing to engage in the production process both as an artist with an intellectual stake in the work and as an adult with a position of real authority in the group. The student will be expected to use that authority while always remaining calm, polite, kind, and generous to the artists with whom they are working.

In this course, students have the opportunity to hone the craft of writing for children and young adults. Through reading, in-class discussion, peer review of student work, and private conferences with the instructor, we will examine the specific requirements of the picture book, the middle-grade novel, and the young adult novel. This analytical study of classic and contemporary literature will inspire and inform students’ creative work in all aspects of storytelling, including character development, plotting, world building, voice, tone, and the roles of illustration and page composition in story narration.

Enrollment Cap: 15; 15 Spaces reserved for 360 students. This course
is open to non-360 students. This course is part of 360 Children's
Books. Through the College’s Ellery Yale Wood Collection of children’s
and young adult books, students will investigate childhood, explore
literature, and creatively engage in the process of writing children’s
literature. The three courses offer differing perspectives on books
written for young readers: as cultural historians and critics, as
creative practitioners, and as people who may shape educational
programs and policies in the future. Historical research, theoretical
examination, investigation of the reception and afterlife of important
stories, and close attention to the materiality of some of the
best-loved objects of childhood will combine with the practical
concerns of creating stories for children and communicating about the
works. If you are interested in the 360 program, you must fill out the
application which is due on April 3rd at NOON by clicking on link.

This is a topics course. Course content varies.; Current topic description: Claude Shannon's foundations of information theory have paved the way for data storage, compression, encoding, and transmission for the Internet, CDs, DVDs, MP3 players, JPEGs, WiFi, iPODs, mobile phones, and a whole host of applications underlying today's information technologies. The past six decades have brought information theory to the crossroads of several traditional disciplines: mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, neurobiology, and electrical engineering. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of Information Theory and leads them to a broader understanding of the concept of ""information"" that transcends boundaries between disciplines, especially between physical and life sciences, communication, and knowledge extraction from massive datasets. Students in several disciplines will be able to draw upon the latest discoveries from multiple disciplines, discuss recent research, and learn to apply the techniques and tools of information-based inquiry in their lives. The course will run in a seminar format where students will engage by participating in and leading discussions and presenting results from readings and computational experiments. The course requires a Junior or Senior standing. Students from ALL disciplines are encouraged to enroll. Haverford: Natural Science (NA)  ( )

Cleopatra VII, the last ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt (69–30 BCE), has been a figure of continuous fascination and political resonance for over 2000 years. She was the most famous and enigmatic person in the ancient Mediterranean world while she was alive and, since then, she has been re-imagined by countless poets, dramatists, philosophers, filmmakers, musicians, and artists of all types. In this course, we will examine both the historical Cleopatra and her reception in various media in subsequent cultures and societies. In the first part, we will carefully study the ancient literary and material evidence to learn all we can about the real Cleopatra and the tumultuous times in which she lived. In the second part, we will then consider a selection of medieval, early modern, and contemporary representations of Cleopatra, ranging from Chaucer to Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra to HBO’s series Rome and the use of Cleopatra in present-day advertising. Throughout our readings, we will focus on issues such as female agency and power in a man’s world, beauty and the femme fatale, east vs. west, and politics and propaganda.

The myths of the Greeks have provoked outrage and fascination, interpretation and retelling, censorship and elaboration, beginning with the Greeks themselves. We will see how some of these stories have been read and understood, recounted and revised, in various cultures and eras, from ancient tellings to modern movies. We will also explore some of the interpretive theories by which these tales have been understood, from ancient allegory to modern structural and semiotic theories. The student should gain a more profound understanding of the meaning of these myths to the Greeks themselves, of the cultural context in which they were formulated. At the same time, this course should provide the student with some familiarity with the range of interpretations and strategies of understanding that people of various cultures and times have applied to the Greek myths during the more than two millennia in which they have been preserved.

This graduate seminar will introduce students to a range of writings produced by exiles, both Roman and “Greek,” in the twilight of the Roman Republic and the first centuries of the Roman Empire. The purpose of the course is to allow students to examine various facets of exilic experience, including: grief, nostalgia, alienation, patriotism, and identity. Students will also consider how Roman imperial expansion conditioned the circumstances of exile and how exiles positioned themselves in relation to imperial power. Throughout the course, students will pay attention the manner in which both the genre of the exilic works under examination and the philosophical commitments of their authors affect the depiction of exile. One session of the course will be devoted to the reception of these texts in later periods. Primary sources are intended to be read in the original languages, but students with an interest in the topic who do not possess knowledge of Greek and/or Latin may make special arrangements with the instructor.

The myths of the Greeks have provoked outrage and fascination, interpretation and retelling, censorship and elaboration, beginning with the Greeks themselves. We will see how some of these stories have been read and understood, recounted and revised, in various cultures and eras, from ancient tellings to modern movies. We will also explore some of the interpretive theories by which these tales have been understood, from ancient allegory to modern structural and semiotic theories. The student should gain a more profound understanding of the meaning of these myths to the Greeks themselves, of the cultural context in which they were formulated. At the same time, this course should provide the student with some familiarity with the range of interpretations and strategies of understanding that people of various cultures and times have applied to the Greek myths during the more than two millennia in which they have been preserved.","Departmental Homepage

Students will learn about: how students’ learning profiles affect their ability to learn in school from a functional perspective; how and why students’ educational experience is affected by education law (especially special education law); major issues in special education;  and how to meet diverse students' needs in an inclusive classroom. Weekly fieldwork required.

The systematic critical exploration of the influence of power in education requires attention and re-conceptualization; this course investigates the following question: how can power be redistributed to ensure equitable educational outcomes? We will examine the production of transformative knowledge, arguing the necessity for including creativity and multi-disciplinary collaboration in contemporary societies. Supporting students’ pursuit of a politics of resistance, subversion, and transformation will allow for the rethinking of traditional education. We will also center the intersections between race, class, gender, sexuality, language, religion, citizenship status, and geographic region, assessing their impact on teaching and learning.

The majority of the most provocative and interesting English-language literary production at the current moment hails from African nations, India, Oceania and their diasporae throughout the world. A significant number of major international literary prizes have been awarded to members of these writing communities who cross borders, continents, passport identities, and traditions in their experiments with narration, place, politics, and the creolization of English. The late Nigerian novelist and memoirist Chinua Achebe said of the English language, in particular: “Do not be fooled by the fact that we may write in English because we intend to do unheard of things with it.”

The study of ""Afro-Futurism"" is the cultural, artistic, and political exploration of African and diasporan visions and critiques of the past, present and future. It presents worlds inflected by the ancient conjurations of African forebears, chattel slaves, and free African Americans from the 19th to the 21st century. The supranatural worlds of Afro-Futurism brings into sharp focus the laws of both nature and society. It has given birth to a revision of the science fiction and fantasy genres by writers such as Nnedi Okorafor, Octavia Butler, Nalo Hopkinson, Tomi Adeyeni, and Deji Bryce Olukotun.

This course explores how various forms of love are imagined in contemporary writing of the African Diaspora. From parent-child affections, to romance and marriage, to the closeness between friends, “love” is a central theme in literature and a crucial part of how we define humanity. Focusing on contemporary texts such as Justin Torres’s We the Animals, Mariama Bâ’s So Long a Letter, Ama Ata Aidoo’s Our Sister Killjoy, Dee Rees’s Pariah, Toni Morrison’s Love, and the works of poets and lyricists including Yusef Komunyakaa, Warsan Shire, Messy Maya, and Cardi B, we will consider how various forms of intimacy are written and read in the African Diaspora. We will read these works alongside key short works from earlier moments in Afrodiasporic literature, as well as theoretical and critical texts in Diaspora feminism, sexuality studies, affect theory, and queer theory to consider several questions: What do literary love relationships reveal about cultural notions of gender, sexuality, class, (dis)ability, embodiment and spirituality? How are intimacy and human connection evoked differently through magic realism, experimentalism, and other Diasporic poetic and aesthetic techniques? What forms and media do black artists use to evoke the love of place, nation and home? What visions of love do these black writers develop, and how do such visions impact how freedom is imagined in Afrodiasporic literature?

Drawing on recent “feminist disability studies” scholarship, this course considers what role disability plays in women’s life writing. We will begin by assessing how, historically, women have been represented as disabled—from Aristotle and Freud’s assertion that women were “deformed” versions of men to Edward H. Clarke’s belief that women were not biologically fit to be educated. We’ll ask: how do the genres of memoir, autobiography, or life writing push back against these gender prescriptions and offer new definitions of what it means to be a disabled woman? How do lesbian and trans identities map onto disability experience? And how do these accounts change both before and after the disability rights movement? Possible course texts include: The Diary of Alice James, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" Helen Keller's The Story of My Life, Katherine Butler Hathaway's The Little Locksmith, Audre Lorde's The Cancer Journals, and Terry Galloway's Mean Little deaf Queer.

Scholars often call the period between the 1850s and the 1910s the “Golden Age” of children’s literature—an age producing such childhood stalwarts as Little Women, The Secret Garden, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Peter and Wendy. This class will offer an introduction to the critical study of Golden Age children’s literature, while also asking that we rethink this age in two principal respects. Making use of the extensive holdings of the Ellery Yale Wood Collection of children’s books, we will begin by questioning how the canon of children’s literature came to be formed by studying established “classics” alongside children’s books by contemporaneous (though traditionally “adult”) writers such as Langston Hughes, Ann Petry, W.E.B. Dubois, and Paul Laurence Dunbar. Moreover, we will examine a recent critical turn in childhood studies that re-evaluates older notions of children’s relationships to agency and identity.

investigate childhood, explore literature, and creatively engage in
the process of writing children’s literature. The three courses offer
differing perspectives on books written for young readers: as cultural
historians and critics, as creative practitioners, and as people who
may shape educational programs and policies in the future. Historical
research, theoretical examination, investigation of the reception and
afterlife of important stories, and close attention to the materiality
of some of the best-loved objects of childhood will combine with the
practical concerns of creating stories for children and communicating
about the works. If you are interested in the 360 program, you must

This course will explore recent “materialist” approaches to literature which reject the notion that what is human is better than what is non-human. Generally what supposedly makes humans valuable is the mind, so we will look at works that treat the mind as just another body part. We will also read some critical theory that explains how valuing the mind over the body, the human over the animal, has been used to support racism, sexism, and colonialism--and has led to the destruction of the ecological system. The course will include both works that present the social, political, and biological horrors resulting from the separation of the non-human from the human, and works that imagine humans merging with nature. The reading in the course will include selections from books of “materialist” theory (such as Jane Bennett’s Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things), novels (Frances Hodgson Burnett, The Secret Garden; Virginia Woolf, The Waves; Franz Kafka, Metamorphosis), nonfiction (Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek), and movies (Ousmane Sembene, Xala).

Tracing an arc from historical analysis to practical engagement, distinctive approaches to key categories of environmental inquiry are presented: political ecology, earth science, energy, economics, public health, ecological design, sustainability, public policy, and environmental ethics. Basic concepts, such as thermodynamics, biodiversity, cost-benefit analysis, scale, modernization, enclosure, the commons, and situational ethics, are variously defined and employed within specific explorations of environmental challenges in the modern world.

We will survey social origins of environmental problems across local to global situations.

Bringing the traditional focus of the humanities–questions of meaning, value, ethics, justice and the politics of knowledge production–into environmental domains calls for a radical reworking of a great deal of what we think we know about ourselves and our fields of inquiry. Inhabiting the difficult space of simultaneous critique and action, this course will re-imagine the proper questions and approaches of the humanities, asking how our accumulated knowledge and practice might be refashioned to meet current environmental challenges, to productively rethink ‘the human’ in more than human terms. In order to resituate the human within the environment, and to resituate nonhumans within cultural and ethical domains, we will draw on a range of texts and films, and engage in a range of critical and creative practices of our own.

How do we best learn a language? By speaking it and by being completely immersed in it. We also learn best when we play. When we have fun and are creative. This workshop will immerse the students in a French only speaking class and they will practice French on their feet. Students will be invited to improvise in French, to create little scenes in French and finally to work on a scene or a monologue from the French repertoire. The class will start with teaching very specific theatrical skills to push the students not only in their ability to speak French but also to act! This will enhance their confidence in speaking, thinking and performing in French, which will lead them to a better mastery of the language.

The libertine movement of the 18th century has long been condemned for moral reasons or considered of minor importance when compared to the Enlightenment. Yet, the right to happiness (‘droit au bonheur’) celebrated by the so-called ‘Philosophes’ implies a duty to experience pleasure (‘devoir de jouir’). This is what the libertine writers promoted. The libertine movement thus does not confine itself to literature, but also involves a dimension of social subversion.

Geology majors choosing to participate in the annual Fall- or Spring-Break Geology Department Field Trip must enroll in GEOL B299. Enrollment in this class does not guarantee a spot on the field trip.  Several pre-trip class meetings help maximize student engagement on the trip by providing a forum for discussing the assigned readings. During the week-long field trip, students are exposed to geologic field methods while visiting sites that exemplify different geology from that at sites near campus. Geologic methods introduced include proper field note-taking, mapping and measuring geologic structures, and interpreting geologic history. Culminating work introduces students to geologic illustration and report writing. A passing grade requires full participation and engagement by the student before, during and after the field trip.  At least one post-trip meeting is held on campus to synthesize the material covered, and to go over students’ final reports.  Prerequisite: GEOL B101, B102 or B103; and GEOL B202, B203, B204 or B205.

This is a topics course. Course content varies. Taught in German.; Current topic description: Sinn und Wahnsinn: Die Literatur des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts ,.Sapere aude!” or “dare to be wise!” declares Kant in his 1784 essay “Answer to the Question, What is Enlightenment?” as the dictum of the Age of Reason. At the center of Enlightenment thought was a mode of being and knowing in the world defined chiefly through the clarity of sight and the use of one’s own rationality. Nevertheless, powerful countercurrents emerge in the literature parallel to and in the wake of Enlightenment that give primacy to feeling, madness, and unrestrainable forces of inspired creativity. Accordingly, these give rise to certain modes of perception, styles of expression, and forms of media that destabilize the Enlightened subject. In this course, we consider this dark side to the Enlightenment as it emerges in tensions between ,,Sinn” and a corresponding ,,Wahnsinn” during the various political, social, cultural, and aesthetic shifts in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We will explore the ways in which this tension is mediated through various modes of self-expression, literary production, and cultural techniques. This course is taught in German.

This course is designed to introduce the student to two of the greatest prose authors of ancient Greece, the philosopher, Plato, and the historian, Thucydides. These two writers set the terms in the disciplines of philosophy and history for millennia, and philosophers and historians today continue to grapple with their ideas and influence. The brilliant and controversial statesman Alcibiades provides a link between the two texts in this course (Plato’s Symposium and Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War), and we examine the ways in which both authors handle the figure of Alcibiades as a point of entry into the comparison of the varying styles and modes of thought of these two great writers.

Using the museums of Philadelphia as field sites, this course provides an introduction to the theoretical and practical aspects of museum studies and the important synergies between theory and practice.  Students will learn: the history of museums as institutions of recreation, education and leisure; how the museum itself became a symbol of power, prestige and sometimes alienation; debates around the ethics and politics of collecting objects of art, culture and nature; and the qualities that make an exhibition effective (or not).  By visiting exhibitions and meeting with a range of museum professionals in art, anthropology and science museums, this course offers a critical perspective on the inner workings of the museum as well as insights into the “new museology.”

This is a topics course. Course content varies.; Current topic description: This seminar examines the ways in which materiality constructs our understanding of South Asian art through particular bodily and sensorial engagements, performance practices, social and spatial relations. How do specific tangible dimensions acquire value in the encounters of an object with its communities of producers and users, while others are muted, elided, or complicated? At the same time, the physical properties of things can mediate between subject and object. And substance or stuff can materialize the abstract and the ineffable. To investigate such issues, we will explore a range of practices from worship in temples and festival celebrations, to the staging of kingship at court, everyday interactions in domestic interiors, and exhibition displays in museums.

This course is a detailed examination of the changing nature and definition of sexuality in Europe from the late nineteenth century to the present.  Throughout the semester we critically examine how understandings of sexuality changed—from how it was discussed and how authorities tried to control it to how the practice of sexuality evolved.  Focusing on both discourses and lived experiences, the class will explore sexuality in the context of the following themes; prostitution and sex trafficking, the rise of medicine with a particular attention to sexology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis; the birth of the homo/hetero/bisexual divide; the rise of the “New Woman”; abortion and contraception; the “sexual revolution” of the 60s; pornography and consumerism; LGBTQ activism; concluding with considering sexuality in the age of cyber as well as genetic technology.  In examining these issues we will question the role and influence of different political systems and war on sexuality.  By paying special attention to the rise of modern nation-states, forces of nationalism, and the impacts of imperialism we will interrogate the nature of regulation and experiences of sexuality in different locations in Europe from the late nineteenth century to the present.

How did we get here? This course looks at the stunning transformation of America after WWII. From a country devastated by economic crisis and wedded to isolationism prior to the war, America turned itself into an international powerhouse. Massive grass roots resistance forced the United States to abandon its system of  racial apartheid, to open opportunities to women, and to reinvent its very definition as it incorporated immigrants from around the world. Simultaneously, American music and film broke free from their staid moorings and permanently altered international culture. Finally, through the ""War on Terror"", starting after 9/11, America initiated an aggressive new foreign policy that has shattered traditional rules of warfare and reoriented global politics.  We will explore the political, social, and cultural factors that have driven modern American history.  Inquiry into the Past (IP)

Latin 001 is the first part of a year-long course that introduces the student to the language and literature of ancient Rome.  The first semester focuses upon the grammar of Latin, developing the student’s knowledge of the forms of the language and the basic constructions used.  Exercises in translation and composition aid in the student’s learning of the language, while readings in prose and poetry from the ancient authors provide the student with a deeper appreciation of the culture which used this language.

This is a topics course.  Course content varies.; Current topic description: Postclassicisms: Flavian/Late Antique/Renaissance This seminar will explore the concept of the “postclassical” and how subsequent authors engage “classical” authors, genres, works, and ideas. We will focus on three distinctive moments in which secondariness emerged as a formative element of aesthetic and intellectual programs: the Flavian period, Late Antiquity (broadly conceived), and the Renaissance (southern and northern). We will consider the configuration and transmission of classical canons and how these spurred envy, anxiety, rivalry, innovation, and (mis)/(re)interpretation (among other creative responses)—as well as the role that postclassical moments played in the construction of the classical. Alongside our collective investigation of a specific text or genre (likely one in prose and one in verse), students will have the opportunity to trace the iterative reception of an author, idea, or genre through these three epochs. Most of the work in the course will be Latin; but there will some opportunities, for those so inclined, to look to Greek as well. Haverford: A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts) (A), Humanities (HU)

This is a topics course.  Course content varies. Not all topics are open to first year students.; Current topic description:This course traces the development of mathematics as we know it today by examining the historical record.  Because the material we consider has been translated directly from an incomplete collection of original sources, we will encounter missing pages, copy errors, and other obstacles to piecing together a coherent story of how mathematics has evolved over time.  The mathematical content of our textbook has not been translated into modern terms or symbols.  It is the original material rewritten (as much as possible) in contemporary English.  You will experience mathematics as it was done hundreds, and even thousands, of years ago.  The mathematics we investigate covers the high school curriculum from numeration and geometry to algebra and calculus.  It is not, however, a high school course.  Many of the topics we consider will be challenging.  You will find familiar ideas presented in unfamiliar ways, and wrestle with results you have never seen before.  Some of it will be enlightening, much of it will be frustrating, and all of it will be fascinating! Prerequisite MATH B203. This does not fulfill Inquiry into the Past (IP) Approach to Inquiry requirement.

What makes us happy?  The wisdom of the ancient world has importantly shaped the tradition of Western thought but in some important respects it has been rejected or forgotten.  What is the nature of reality?  Can we have knowledge about the world and ourselves, and, if so, how?  In this course we explore answers to these sorts of metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, and political questions by examining the works of the two central Greek philosophers:  Plato and Aristotle.  We will consider earlier Greek religious and dramatic writings, a few Presocratic philosophers, and the person of Socrates who never wrote a word.

In this course, we explore answers to fundamental questions about the nature of the world and our place in it by examining the works of some of the central figures in modern western philosophy. Can we obtain knowledge of the world and, if so, how? Does God exist? What is the nature of the self? How do we determine morally right answers? What sorts of policies and political structures can best promote justice and equality? These questions were addressed in “modern” Europe in the context of the development of modern science and the religious wars. In a time of globalization we are all, more or less, heirs of the Enlightenment which sees its legacy to be modern science and the mastery of nature together with democracy and human rights. This course explores the above questions and considers them in their historical context. Some of the philosophers considered include Descartes, Locke, Hume, Kant, and Wollstonecraft.

Scientific ideas and inferences have a huge impact on our daily lives and the lives of practicing scientists. But what is science, how does it work, and what does it able us to know? In this introductory course, we will be considering some traditional philosophical questions applied to the foundations and practice of natural science. These questions may include the history of philosophical approaches in science, the nature of scientific knowledge, changes in scientific knowledge over time, how science provides explanations of what we observe, the justification of false assumptions in science, the nature of scientific theories, and some questions about the ethics and values involved in scientific practice.

What is the relationship between the mind and the body? What is consciousness? Is your mind like a computer, or do some aspects of the mind resist this analogy? Is it possible to build an artificial mind? In this course, we'll explore these questions and more, drawing on perspectives from philosophy, psychology and cognitive neuroscience. We will consider the viability of different ways of understanding the relationship between mind and body as a framework for studying the mind, as well as the distinctive issues that arise in connection with the phenomenon of consciousness. No prior knowledge or experience with any of the subfields is assumed or necessary.

This upper-level seminar will consider the two main proponents of phenomenology—a movement in philosophy in the 20th century that attempted to restart philosophy in a radical way. Its concerns are philosophically comprehensive: ontology, epistemology, philosophy of science, ethics, and so on. Phenomenology provides the important background for other later developments in 20th-century philosophy and beyond: existentialism, deconstruction, post-modernism. This seminar will focus primarily on Edmund Husserl’s Crisis of the European Sciences and Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time. Other writings to be considered include some of Heidegger’s later work and Merleau-Ponty’s preface to his Phenomenology of Perception. Haverford: Humanities (HU)  ( )","Departmental Homepage

This seminar introduces the intellectual history of comparative politics, and explore the primary approaches and concepts scholars employ in order to systematically analyze the political world. In doing so, we will also examine the political structures, institutions, and behaviors of a number of countries around the world. Key questions we will discuss include: What is power and how is it exercised? What are the differences between democratic and authoritarian regimes? How do different countries develop their economies? What factors affect the way that countries behave in the international arena? By the end of this course, students will be equipped to answer these questions, and prepared for further study in political science. Freshman may not take this course and can take POLS B131.

The last election cycle has seen political candidates using various media to interact with voters, to persuade them to vote to one candidate or dissuade them from voting for another. From printed targeted advertising, to TV ads, social media posts, political satire, televised debates, and automated calls, media have been a key component in both parties’ campaign strategy. This relationship between the media and the political arena, however, is not a new phenomenon, and the field of political communication has been exploring it for nearly a century, drawing on various fields from political science and psychology to computer science, sociology and more. This course is aimed at introducing students to this rich area of research, providing an overview of the various facets of the discipline, from media effects theories such as cognitive dissonance, framing and priming to critical, cultural, and normative theories on the role of the media in modern democracy. Most importantly, class discussions will examine current political issues (such as social protests, foreign affairs coverage, political campaigns, social media and political entertainment) exploring whether these older theories and approaches are still relevant in a media landscape so different (in quantity and quality) from the one in which they were originated - and what can we learn from them about modern political phenomena.

This writing-intensive seminar (maximum enrollment = 16 students) deals with critical analysis of how various forms of psychopathology are depicted in films. The primary focus of the seminar will be evaluating the degree of correspondence between the cinematic presentation and current research knowledge about the disorder, taking into account the historical period in which the film was made.  For example, we will discuss how accurately the symptoms of the disorder are presented and how representative the protagonist is of people who typically manifest this disorder based on current research. We will also address the theory of etiology of the disorder depicted in the film, including discussion of the relevant intellectual history in the period when the film was made and the prevailing accounts of psychopathology in that period. Another focus will be how the film portrays the course of the disorder and how it depicts treatment for the disorder. This cinematic presentation will be evaluated with respect to current research on treatment for the disorder as well as the historical context of prevailing treatment for the disorder at the time the film was made.  Prerequisite: PSYC B209.

For its unique history, the number of migrants, and the two countries' proximity, Mexican migration to the United States represents an exceptional case in world migration. There is no other example of migration with more than 100 years of history. The copious presence of migrants concentrated in a host country, such as we have in the case of the 11.7 million Mexican migrants residing in the United States, along with another 15 million Mexican descendants, is unparalleled. The 1,933-mile-long border shared by the two countries makes it one of the longest boundary lines in the world and, unfortunately, also one of the most dangerous frontiers in the world today. We will examine the different economic, political, social and cultural forces that have shaped this centenarian migration influx and undertake a macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of analysis. At the macro-level of political economy, we will investigate the economic interdependency that has developed between Mexico and the U.S. over different economic development periods of these countries, particularly, the role the Mexican labor force has played to boosting and sustaining both the Mexican and the American economies. At the meso-level, we will examine different institutions both in Mexico and the U.S. that have determined the ways in which millions of Mexican migrate to this country. Last, but certainly not least, we will explore the impacts that both the macro-and meso-processes have had on the micro-level by considering the imperatives, aspirations, and dreams that have prompted millions of people to leave their homes and communities behind in search of better opportunities. This major life decision of migration brings with it a series of social transformations in family and community networks, this will look into the cultural impacts in both the sending and receiving migrant communities. In sum, we will come to understand how these three levels of analysis work together.

This course will examine childhood from a sociological perspective. We will focus on how children shape and are shaped by their social worlds. We will begin by considering childhood as a historically constructed category that has changed over time and place. We will next focus on three institutions that are key agents of childhood socialization: the family, the school, and peers. Finally, we will study topics that may be considered problems of childhood: commercialization and technology use, the medicalization of aspects of children’s life experiences, and delinquency and crime. Throughout the course, we will consider how children’s lives are shaped by broader systems of inequality based on race, class, and gender.

literature, and creatively engage in the process of writing children’s
literature. The three courses offer differing perspectives on books
written for young readers: as cultural historians and critics, as
creative practitioners, and as people who may shape educational
programs and policies in the future. Historical research, theoretical
examination, investigation of the reception and afterlife of important
stories, and close attention to the materiality of some of the
best-loved objects of childhood will combine with the practical
concerns of creating stories for children and communicating about the
works.This 360 cluster includes enrolling in, ARTW B269 & ENGL B289.

The course broadly explores the biological, psychological, and social aspects of aging into middle and late adulthood for individual, families, communities, and society at large.  This is accomplished through exploration of a.) the psychological and social developmental challenges of adulthood, b.) the core biological changes that accompany this stage of life, c.) research methodology for inquiry into aging, d.) the demands and impact on care givers and families, e.) psychopathology common in older adults, f.) social welfare policies and programs designed to ameliorate stress and promote well-being among older adults, and g.) the political, social, and academic discourse around the concept of aging successfully in the 21st century.  Throughout the course, the experience of aging, and the ways in which this experience differs by race, ethnicity, gender, class, culture, and sexual orientation are considered.  This course builds on theory, knowledge, and skills of social work with older adults introduced in Foundation Practice and Human Behavior in the Social Environment I and III.

Whether as an administrator, staff /service provider or board member, or even as a consumer, we all have multiple opportunities to interact with organizations.  This course explores the 10 basic components of organizations which impact people, place, processes, and placement.  In this seminar-style class, students will contribute as both teachers and learners in the study of how people, as individuals and as groups, operate within the context of change that surrounds today’s organizations.  The skills taught in this course will help students think about, advocate within, elicit change from, and lead organizations.  We will use a “10-S” model of organizational practice to guide our thinking.  This model champions multicultural competency and examines a number of mezzo- and macro-level influencing factors.  For instance, we will consider how even an organization’s physical setting impacts the delivery of its mission.  Also examined is the leadership style of organizational administrations as well as the types of staff and their skills, and the agency’s shared values, strategy, structure, systems, and the services provided to diverse  stakeholders.  In the course of the semester, students will explore these organizational components, their interrelatedness, and reciprocal impacts through individual and small group presentations, self-reflection exercises, and a final paper.  A particular emphasis will be placed on ways to invoke both ‘right brain’ /synthesizing and non-linear thinking  with more  ‘left-brain’/ analytical methods to  better understand the responsibilities  and various styles of  effective leaders. This class will be interactive, co-constructed, and provide foundational theories and practical skills.

Social Work, Trauma, and the Arts provides instruction for social work students seeking to understand and apply the arts to encounters with traumatized individuals, communities, and systems.  The course, which uses creative engagement and didactic strategies, is divided into three phases.  In the introductory phase, participants will learn basic information about (1) the impact of trauma, (2) the consequences of trauma exposure, (3) the neurobiological implications of traumatization, and (4) best practices and common factors in trauma treatment. In the second phase, students will explore the relationship between social work, creativity, and trauma healing.

Supported by the Teaching and Learning Institute (TLI) and a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, this series of pedagogy workshops for graduate students may be taken in its entirety for course credit, or individual workshops may be attended as stand-alone sessions. Seven two-hour workshops focused on a variety of pedagogical issues (e.g., course design, teaching styles, creating culturally responsive classrooms, grading) are scheduled for both the fall and the spring semesters.* These are interactive workshops, some of which require the completion of reading in advance and some of which include discussion of texts during the workshops themselves, but all of which focus on active, collaborative explorations of pedagogical issues. A full list of the workshop topics is available through the Dean's Office. These workshops count toward the completion of the Dean's Certificate in Pedagogy (http://www.brynmawr.edu/gsas/Resources/certificate.html).

Taught in Philadelphia as part of the Tri-Co Philly Program, this transdisciplinary, Philadelphia-based, course focuses on critical urban environmental issues. With the blunt challenges of global warming and inequality in mind, we seek to apply theory to the practice of engagement with ongoing urban struggles. Collaborative environmental work with urban communities is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on anthropology, urban planning, public health, ecology, and geography. Themes will include the intersections of race, class, and gender; environmental justice; rethinking bioregionalism; urban environmental social movements; urban farming/gardening; brownfields; radical municipalism; tactical urbanism; transformative education; Afrofuturism; action research; and ideas of place, home and nature. The course will focus on the ethics and practice of community collaboration and community-based research in environmental work in urban settings. Students will work directly with community groups, developing relationships, and collaborating on research relevant to their efforts. As the course title indicates, the arts of collaboration—on multiple levels—are central to this course. Readings include: Joan Iverson Nassauer, Roger Sanjek, Peter Berg, Donald Schon, Anne Rademencher, Gregory Bateson, Jane Jacobs, Grace Lee Boggs Meredith Minkler, Baltimore Ecosystem Study, adrienne maree brown, Davydd Greenwod, Miles Horton; Eve Tuck, Kim Fortun, Julian Agyeman.; Crosslisted: Anthropology, Environmental Studies; Enrollment Limit: 15. Priority in registration will be given to students participating in the Philly Program.  Remaining seats are available to other Tri-Co students, by lottery, if demand exceeds remaining spaces in the course. If you are interested in the Philly Program, you must fill out the application (https://www.haverford.edu/tri-co-philly-program/student-application), which is due on Friday, March 29 at 5 pm. This program includes registering for the program’s core course, Fight for #PhlEd: Urban Educational and Environmental Justice (EDUC 067), and one of the following three elective courses: Environmental Justice: Theory and Action (ENVS 035/POLS 043B); Place, People and Collaborative Research in Philadelphia (ANTH H309/ENVS H309); or Math Modeling and Sustainability (MATH B295).

Representing the Holocaust has often been posed as a limit or impossibility within the literary and visual arts. Despite such statements, we find numerous instances of artists turning to literature, film, and other aesthetic media in order to recall, confront, and grapple with the atrocities committed by Germans and Austrians during the Nazi period. How do we understand such impossible representations their different, representational strategies, as well as their ethical, political, and historical status? Covering an international range of literary texts and films along with examples from the visual arts, this seminar will investigate works that attempt to represent the traumatic experiences, historical events, and lasting consequences of the Holocaust through various genres and perspectives. Students will gain familiarity with recent developments in trauma and memory studies, as well as key debates on artistic representations and historical understandings of German fascism, anti-Semitism, and the Nazi genocide.

This course provides a boldly revisionist perspective on the emergence of our contemporary world. Though rooted in the social and cultural transformations of the late medieval and early modern eras, course materials and class discussions will range from the ancient past into our twenty first century present. As we pursue a common human history, we shall consider diverse local trajectories as well as shared trans-regional experiences, and examine them in a manner suggestive of possible futures. During the first half of the semester, we will analyze Asia, Africa and the Americas prior to the emergence of Iberian (Portuguese and Spanish) colonialism. In the second half of the semester we will assess the increasingly interconnected world negotiated in the centuries after 1492, a useful though controversial date signifying the beginnings of a truly global history.

Introduces students to the historical study of empires and the circumstances and consequences of their collapse by focusing on the Ottoman Empire. A cluster of recent studies treat the history of the Ottoman Empire (1453-1923) as a complex, dynamic and changing entity revising the older perspectives that viewed it as epitomizing the supposedly backward, unchanging, and mysterious Orient. Based on the more accessible works among this new literature, the course examines the transformation of the Ottoman Empire in terms of its political structures, its ties with Islam, its social make-up and its economy, as well as its relationship with Europe and its responses to the forces of modernity.

What are the worldwide obstacles to peace and justice? How can we surmount them? This course examines theories of some of the leading obstacles to peace and justice worldwide, and of what global citizens can do about them. The three obstacles we consider are colonialism and its legacies, whether we live in a global racial order, and whether the global economic order harms the poor and does them a kind of violence. The two solutions we will consider are the project of economic and social development, and the practice of human rights. The course aims, first, to give students some of the knowledge they will need to address these problems and be effective global citizens. Second, to understand some of the major forces that shape the present world order. Third and finally, to hone the skills in analysis, theory-building, and arguing that are highly valued in legal and political advocacy, in public life and the professions, and in graduate school.; Crosslisted: Independent College Programs, Political Science; Enrollment Limit: 15; Lottery Preference(s): Returning CPGC Interns Social Justice, Social Science, B: Analysis of the Social World (; Hav: SJ, SO, B)","Link to Departmental Homepage

We’ll also spend some time learning to converse and write in Latin, joining a history of conversation that stretches from the early Latin speakers of southern Europe and northern Africa, to the learned humanists of the Renaissance, and down to the present day.

How do you identify yourself—as a human, as a person from a specific time and place, as a person with particular needs and desires? As that identity evolves, do you remain the same person? How much control can you have over the way others identify you? Do your pets secretly talk when you're not around? Why can you love a person and loath them at the same time? In this course, we will meet a set of ancient Roman authors who were as consumed by questions of love and identity as we are in our lives today. First, we'll settle back into reading Latin with a selection of children's stories about talking animals. We'll then read excerpts from Apuleius' Metamorphoses, or The Golden Ass; written by an African philosopher who was once put on trial for sorcery, this novel traces the adventures of a man cursed to become a donkey. Finally, we'll read the poems of the great Catullus, as famous for their beauty as for their explicit sexuality and biting attacks on Catullus' artistic and erotic rivals.; Prerequisite(s): LATN 101 or BMC 003 or instructor consent for students with very strong HS prep Humanities, A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts) (Hav: HU, A)","Link to Departmental Homepage

In this course, we will read a selection of comedies by Plautus and Terence. These fast-paced stage plays range from urbanely witty to raucously hilarious - and are much funnier in the original Latin we will be reading than they are in translation. In addition to their humor, however, these plays also give us access to parts of Roman life sometimes missing from the great works of Latin literature: they show us immigrants and the enslaved, sex workers and poor soldiers, young people falling in love, parents worrying about their children, siblings and friends negotiating difficult relationships. Plautus, moreover, is the earliest Roman author whose works survive intact; Terence is Latin's earliest African author, and one of the few enslaved Roman authors whose writings we can read today.; Prerequisite(s): Two semesters of 100-level Latin, or instructor consent Humanities, A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts) (Hav: HU, A)","Link to Departmental Homepage

In the process, students will develop skills in observing syntactic patterns and analyzing these patterns in order to come to some generalizations on their own.; Enrollment Limit: 25; Lottery Preference(s):; (1) Sr. Ling Majors; (2) Jr. Ling Majors; (3) Sr. Ling Minors; (4) Jr. Ling Minors; (5) Neuroscience minors; (6) sophomores; (7) first years; (8) everyone else (jrs/seniors) Humanities, Symbolic Reasoning, B: Analysis of the Social World (; Hav: HU, QUS, B)","Link to Departmental Homepage

An intensive introduction to the notational and theoretical materials of music, complemented by work in sight-singing, keyboard harmony, and dictation. This course is appropriate for students who sing or play an instrument, but who have had little or no systematic instruction in music theory. Topics include time and pitch and their notation, scales, intervals, triads, basic harmonic progressions, melodic construction, harmonization of melody, non-harmonic tones, transposition, and key change (modulation). Students who wish to explore the art of musical composition will find this course especially useful, as two creative projects are assigned: the composition of a pair of melodies in the major and minor modes, and a 32-bar piece which changes key. Preparation for these projects is provided through listening and analysis of works in a variety of musical styles. Students having completed this course will be prepared to enter Music 203, the first semester of the theory sequence for music majors.

When does music history begin in the West? How has Western music evolved and—just as importantly—why? This course teaches students to hear how musical style changes over time while considering the social and technological conditions that underpin such changes. We listen closely and critically to works by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and Stravinsky, among others, discussing these using a precise shared vocabulary. At the same time, we read historical documents closely related to musical sound: Bach’s frustrating negotiations with his church employers; Wolfgang Mozart’s intimate letters to his father and musical mentor, Leopold; the emotional testament in which Beethoven grapples with his hearing loss. Ultimately, we traverse a thousand years to discover how Western music went from being a liturgical ritual of plain, unaccompanied song to an extravagant secular form of entertainment for elite audiences in modern cities. No prior musical knowledge is required.

",,"Class Number: 2316
In this course, through the poetry, sculpture, history, architecture, painting, philosophy, and oratory produced by the inhabitants of fifth-century Athens, we will examine the daily workings of Athenian democracy, economy, love, art, science, education, and religion. As we conduct our inquiry into Athens' ""Golden Age,"" we willl seek to discover ourselves in these ancient voices, and to illuminate the contrasts inherent between Athens and modernity. Restless, wary, elegant, vulgar, pious, and brutal, the Athenians left a legacy that continues to define and influence human achievement (and travails) to this day. In the last third of the class, students will embark on a multi-week simulation to rebuild Athens in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian Wars.; Crosslisted: Classical Studies, PJHR; Enrollment Limit: 45 Humanities, B: Analysis of the Social World, A: Meaning, Interpretation (Texts) (Hav: HU, B, A)","Link to Departmental Homepage

This course examines the concept of inheritance as a transfer of physical, social, linguistic, economic and behavioral capacities. Inheritance is unique, as Kant notes, as a transfer or gift that typically cannot be refused.  Despite being involuntary recipients of our inherited capacities, we often imagine our having intentionally developed and earned them, whether advantageous or disadvantageous. By examining theories of how inheritances proceed across and through individuals and groups, especially via relations thought inheritably impotent (e.g., race and queerness), we will contemplate these movements as ethical genealogies, that is, as historical transfers of value (economic, social, dispositional) that configure recognition of our embodied selves.

The Soviet system was inspired by some of the loftiest ideals of humanity. The entire society was redesigned so as to pursue common goals, rather than conflicting private objectives. The economy was run for people, not profits. The Soviet system is no more, but the ideas on which it was founded will probably always be with us. What does the largest social and economic experiment in history teach us?

What are the worldwide obstacles to peace and justice? How can we surmount them? This course examines theories of some of the leading obstacles to peace and justice worldwide, and of what global citizens can do about them. The three obstacles we consider are colonialism and its legacies, whether we live in a global racial order, and whether the global economic order harms the poor and does them a kind of violence. The two solutions we will consider are the project of economic and social development, and the practice of human rights. The course aims, first, to give students some of the knowledge they will need to address these problems and be effective global citizens. Second, to understand some of the major forces that shape the present world order. Third and finally, to hone the skills in analysis, theory-building, and arguing that are highly valued in legal and political advocacy, in public life and the professions, and in graduate school.; Crosslisted: Independent College Programs, Political Science; Enrollment Limit: 15; Lottery Preference(s): Returning CPGC Interns Social Justice, Social Science, B: Analysis of the Social World (; Hav: SJ, SO, B)","Link to Departmental Homepage

The Soviet system was inspired by some of the loftiest ideals of humanity. The entire society was redesigned so as to pursue common goals, rather than conflicting private objectives. The economy was run for people, not profits. The Soviet system is no more, but the ideas on which it was founded will probably always be with us. What does the largest social and economic experiment in history teach us? The course is 1/3 political science and 2/3 economics. ; Crosslisted: Economics, Political Science, Russian; Prerequisite(s): ECON 104, 105, or 106, or two one-semester courses in political science or history, or instructor consent

This course examines the social organization of political power in the U.S., focusing on the State, the influence of economic power (corporations & the economic elite) on political decision making, and “democracy”: to what degree are we a democratic nation, what is the state of democracy now, and what might the future hold? We will explore the foundations of the major theories of state and social power—class (Marx), elite (Weber), and pluralist (de Toqueville) as well as more contemporary theories.

What have been the literary uses of Quaker ideas and images in fiction? How have these changed over time? Here on the Haverford campus, with its Quaker heritage and traditions, is housed perhaps the largest collection of Quaker novels anywhere in the world, fiction by or about Quakers, often populated with characters whose Quakerliness is designed to evoke a certain mood, message, or subtext. For some authors, Quakers became stand-ins for virtue. For others, the Quaker image is of the troublemaker, the nay-sayer, the haughty, unbending zealot. In this course we will read excerpts from an array of Quaker fiction. Then, through class discussions, written essays, and through considering each others writing, students will explore how commentators have interpreted the meaning of ""Quakerness"" in literature.""

Students in this course will examine some of the changes that Orthodox Quakerism underwent between the 1860s and the 1940s by analyzing the life and thought of Rufus Jones (1863-1948).

It looks at the ways in which architecture may respond to the political, social, and philosophical implications of diverse ecological perspectives and uncovers the part architecture plays in environmental preservation and degradation. The class takes as its starting point colonial settlements and Native American land use patterns in the Eastern United States and concludes with national responses to 21st-century climate change discourse, paying particular attention to fluctuating conceptions of wildness and nature over time and to the wider socio-cultural implications of these attitudes.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

It begins with an examination of current debates that define theory, method, and goals in black studies. It also examines the movement from the more object centered Africana studies to subject- and agentic oriented black studies that occurred as a result of civil rights and anti-colonialist movements in the U.S., Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe. The course examines the challenges that were levied against traditional academic disciplines with the rise of anti-racist scholarship. It briefly examines the conversation between American, Caribbean, and African postcolonialists, and it allows students to delve into some of black studies' most current and exciting scholarship, with a focus on the U.S.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

This course will explore the literary and historical significance of this output, which mainly took the form of poetry and prefaces to poetry collections, letters, some drama, and novels in verse, and which was produced primarily by gentry women (e.g. women from elite families), courtesans, and nuns. A central theme will be the place and problem of women's poetry in a male-dominated literary tradition and society. Topics to be addressed include the social function of poetry and women's literary networks, women's relationship to the publishing market as writers, editors, and readers, the forces driving male interest in women's writing at certain historical moments, and the changing ideas about what kinds of styles of past poets should be offered to boudoir poets as a repertoire of available choices to read and imitate.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

Students will learn how to read closely and intensively and how to analyze each work in terms of its formal conventions, it cultural and historical context, and its relation to other forms or to other individual pieces. Regular assignments include short papers and presentations in modern Mandarin about classical Chinese poetry, translations of classical Chinese into English, and a final presentation/paper that synthesizes knowledge of a classical Chinese genre, poet, or theme with the English/Chinese language scholarship on that topic.Prerequisite: Four years of Chinese or the equivalent.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

",Lang Perf Arts Ctr 003,"How does a dance get made?Dance Lab I provides introductory context to approaches, methods, and strategies a dancer-choreographer of any background might use to choreograph dance performance.  Through in-class workshops and weekly assignments, Dance Lab I engages and develops our skilled employment of the choreographic elements of Time, Force, and Space - with attention to structural organization and creative processes (the 'how' and 'why' of dance creation).Additional topics in Dance Lab I may include movement invention and motivation from the body (as spatial sculpture, rhythmic instrument, or as symbolically linked to text embedded with social, political, and psychological meaning including memoir and narrative), collaboration within design contexts (such as light, sound, music, and props), dance film, and site specificity.  Assignments center upon the creation and in-class showing of weekly short dance studies as solos, duets, and possibly group work.Related assignments include reading, video, and live concert viewing, as well as two short papers.A special professional guest choreographer may also teach some classes and give assignments.Prerequisite: Any dance course, dance or movement training, or permission of the instructor. (If interested in the course but unsure, please consult with the instructor).Corequisite: A course in dance technique must be taken concurrently.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

",Lang Music Building 204,"This course explores intersections in African diaspora dance studies and black performance theory.  Topics covered include: philosophies of blackness and identity; intersections of gender and sexuality with race and dancing bodies; the role of embodiment in historical black liberation struggles; global transmissions and transformations of dance practices; black articulations of social and concert dance; and questions about the relationship between agency and movement.  Key theorists such as Brenda Dixon Gottschild, Stuart Hall, E. Patrick Johnson, Saidiya Hartman, and Thomas DeFrantz will be discussed.  Students will gain familiarity with connections between practice and theoretical discourse through written exercises, oral presentations, lecture, video analysis, movement studies, and group discussion.  The goal of this course is three-fold: (1) to explore the political implications of dancing blackness in performances of everyday life and onstage (2) to understand how diasporic dance practices are bodily enactments of specific historical, cultural and political developments and (3) to investigate different approaches to writing about their significance in order to develop critical perspectives as thinkers and potential dance makers.

There will be both critical and creative writing assignments in the class.John Gardner rewrote the ancient epic Beowulf in modern idiom from the monster's viewpoint. Tom Stoppard showed us what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were up to offstage in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Angela Carter's Red Riding Hood was fascinated by the company of wolves. Students will study old texts and their modern revisions and then write both critical papers about the them and also, using the re-telling models as starting points, reshape their own beautiful or beastly visions in creative writing forms. Here are some retelling slants: What is the story of the rat in Cinderella who is turned into a coachman?  What is Ophelia dreaming in Hamlet as she slides into the netherworld of drowning and death?  What is the mute lullaby which Grendel's mother uses to sing him (or herself) to sleep in her underwater cave each night?  What might the wolf in LRRH and Grendel have to say to one another over cappuccino in Kohlberg?This First-year Seminar counts as both a Writing Class (W) and an English Dept.

Students will learn the basics in understanding and enjoying the music of poetry, including scansion and prosody (beats and sounds). They will also learn to appreciate the basic forms of lyric poetry, including ballads and sonnets and many other forms, as well as ""free"" verse; they will also receive instruction on how to appreciate metaphors, irony, and the many other figures of speech and rhetorical techniques poems employ. They will also gain appreciation of poetic history and the many ways in which poets and their work have historically interacted with their eras, while also creating work that can powerfully speak to us in our present moment.We'll use The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms (Ed. Mark Strand and Eavon Boland) and Camille Paglia's Break, Blow, Burn, a collection of essays on some of the most famous poems in English. Other course materials will be posted as needed on the English 71B Moodle site.This course is focused on great poems from the past (from the medieval era to the twentieth century), but both Making of a Poem and Paglia treat us to some very contemporary poems and poets as well.For majors and minors, this course can count either as a Med/Ren, 18th/19th, or 20th/21st century course, depending on the topics of the majority of the student's written work.

In many ways, pesticides, oil, and plutonium structure our lives; they impact our health, our politics, and may even threaten the existence of life itself. Ironically, because these materials permeate nearly every aspect of our existence, the human mind can struggle to comprehend them. In this course, we will read literature that engages with our environment to help us bring humans' relationship to these materials into focus. Scientific, historical, and economic studies of these materials tend to focus on their scale and widespread impact. Reading poetry, plays, short stories, and novels will allow us to imagine these materials more intimately-through individual, cultural, and aesthetic perspectives.  In this course, students will ask: How can literature help us to understand-and perhaps change-our material, economic, and social environments? How has our relationship to materials changed over time? How do environmental and material realities impact cultural production and imagination? Texts under discussion will likely include: Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962); Terry Tempest Williams' Refuge (1991); Mark Nowak's Coal Mountain Elementary (2009); Lesley Battler's Endangered Hydrocarbons (2015); Andrew Bovell's When the Rain Stops Falling (2012); Adam Dickinson's The Polymers (2013); and two films: Hiroshima mon Amour (dir.

This course will explore the problem of the minor character and the ordinary person from the conflicting and complementary perspectives of the historians and the literary critic, using both traditional and computational methods. Are there formal analytic strategies for interpreting and examining minor characters and ordinary individuals that do not insist on moving them from the margins to the center? Or are all minor characters simply understudy protagonists and consequential people waiting for their time in the spotlight? We will trace this problem through major works of history and literature and through their transformation and interpretation using qualitative and quantitative methods.

In turn, it examines how various religious worldviews can aid the development of an earth-centered philosophy of life. The thesis of this course is that the environment crisis, at its core, is a spiritual crisis because it is human beings' deep ecocidal dispositions toward nature that are the cause of the earth's continued degradation. Course topics include ecological thought in Western philosophy, theology, and biblical studies; the role of Asian religious thought in forging an ecological worldview; the value of American nature writings for environmental awareness, including both Euro-American and Amerindian literatures; the public policy debates concerning vegetarianism and the antitoxics movement; and the contemporary relevance of ecofeminism, deep ecology, Neopaganism, and wilderness activism.

",Lang Center 106,"(Cross-listed as ENGL 089B)Pollutants. Fossil Fuels. Atomic Bombs. In many ways, pesticides, oil, and plutonium structure our lives; they impact our health, our politics, and may even threaten the existence of life itself. Ironically, because these materials permeate nearly every aspect of our existence, the human mind can struggle to comprehend them. In this course, we will read literature that engages with our environment to help us bring humans' relationship to these materials into focus. Scientific, historical, and economic studies of these materials tend to focus on their scale and widespread impact. Reading poetry, plays, short stories, and novels will allow us to imagine these materials more intimately-through individual, cultural, and aesthetic perspectives.  In this course, students will ask: How can literature help us to understand-and perhaps change-our material, economic, and social environments? How has our relationship to materials changed over time? How do environmental and material realities impact cultural production and imagination? Texts under discussion will likely include: Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962); Terry Tempest Williams' Refuge (1991); Mark Nowak's Coal Mountain Elementary (2009); Lesley Battler's Endangered Hydrocarbons (2015); Andrew Bovell's When the Rain Stops Falling (2012); Adam Dickinson's The Polymers (2013); and two films: Hiroshima mon Amour (dir. Alain Resnais, 1959) and There Will Be Blood (dir. Paul Anderson, 2007).  Course requirements include active participation; a close-reading paper; an engaged assignment; and a final research paper.

The interdisciplinary nature of the course demands multiple points of entry to communicate and analyze these issues beyond reading and writing, such as films, podcasts, lectures.

",Trotter Hall 203,"(Cross-listed as ENGL 090A)Novels, social media, close friends, and parents help us feel like main characters in our own lives, but most of us will remain minor, relatively unimportant characters in any larger context. This course will explore the problem of the minor character and the ordinary person from the conflicting and complementary perspectives of the historians and the literary critic, using both traditional and computational methods. Are there formal analytic strategies for interpreting and examining minor characters and ordinary individuals that do not insist on moving them from the margins to the center? Or are all minor characters simply understudy protagonists and consequential people waiting for their time in the spotlight? We will trace this problem through major works of history and literature and through their transformation and interpretation using qualitative and quantitative methods. Students will create an original essay, art project or other work on a minor character or about the idea of minor character as part of the course's final publication project.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

The emperor Claudius, made generally famous by the classic TV series ""I Claudius,"" presents similar questions. He was a transformative figure in Roman imperial history, responsible for the creation of a civil service, expansion of the Roman citizenship, and the conquest of Britain. But he also had medical problems, and made some spectacularly inappropriate marriages. The principal Latin texts will be Suetonius' Life of Gaius Caligula, Tacitus' bitter account of Claudius in his Annals, and selected documents (inscriptions and Latin papyri). We will also read Seneca's exposition of Stoic ideals in his de Providentia, and Seneca's (?) Apocolocyntosis, a spoof account of Claudius' posthumous journey to heaven.Can serve as an honors preparation when combined with a one credit attachment.Writing course.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

Taboo terms also vary in how they are used: exclamations, name-calling, and maledictions are common, but other uses can appear, such as modifiers and predicates. Over time less common uses tend to semantically bleach, so that historical taboo terms can be used without hint of vulgarity or rudeness. These less common uses can fall together with slang in exhibiting linguistic behavior unique within that language, at the word level and the phrase and sentence level, behavior that is telling with respect to linguistic theory.

",Kohlberg 330,"(Cross-listed as CHIN 036)Contrary to our stereotypes about the silent, invisible woman of premodern China, women actually wrote and published their work in unprecedented numbers from the late 16th century to the early 20th century. This course will explore the literary and historical significance of this output, which mainly took the form of poetry and prefaces to poetry collections, letters, some drama, and novels in verse, and which was produced primarily by gentry women (e.g. women from elite families), courtesans, and nuns. A central theme will be the place and problem of women's poetry in a male-dominated literary tradition and society. Topics to be addressed include the social function of poetry and women's literary networks, women's relationship to the publishing market as writers, editors, and readers, the forces driving male interest in women's writing at certain historical moments, and the changing ideas about what kinds of styles of past poets should be offered to boudoir poets as a repertoire of available choices to read and imitate.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

",Kohlberg 326,"(Cross-listed as CHIN 037)Combining some of the greatest works of Chinese poetry with approaches and visual materials from the history of Chinese landscape painting, in this course we will examine the changing use of landscape as a medium to express different philosophical and social meanings by competing social groups across historical periods from early times to the 13th century.  In the first half of this course, we will see how natural landscape in poetry became a medium for conveying a range different ideals and problems: official service and reclusion in the countryside, Daoist liberation and Buddhist enlightenment, the sorrows of war on the frontier or travel into exile.  In the second half of this course, we then apply our knowledge of Chinese poetry to interpreting a series of paintings from the Song dynasty (960-1279).  This period is the golden age of Chinese landscape painting.  It saw the emergence of literati-painters who, much like the great painters of the Renaissance, argued that painting possessed the same expressive power as poetry.  We will explore the ways they employed painting to comment on an unprecedented range of issues, including government affairs, the role of women in society, the relation of private to public life, as well as the experience of dynastic collapse and war.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

",Science Center 101,"In Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies, we learn that peace and conflict are not mutually exclusive. To paraphrase Conrad Brunk, the goal of peace and conflict studies is to better understand conflict in order to find nonviolent ways of turning unjust relationships into more just ones. We examine both the prevalence of coercive and non-peaceful means of conducting conflict as well as the development of nonviolent alternatives, locally and globally, through institutions and at the grassroots. The latter include nonviolent collective action, mediation, peacekeeping, and conflict transformation work. Several theoretical and philosophical lenses will be used to explore cultural and psychological dispositions, conflict in human relations, and conceptualizations of peace. The course will take an interdisciplinary approach with significant contributions from the social sciences. U.S.-based social justice movements, such as the struggle for racial equality, and global movements, such as nonviolent activism in Israel/Palestine, and the struggle for climate justice around the world, will serve as case studies.  ","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

After studying the civil wars and their causes, the course will then focus on the peacebuilding efforts and the implementation of democracy within the neoliberal economic order. Of particular interest are the failures of the peacebuilding process, the current gang violence in the region, and the widespread political corruption supported by an economic system that has made of everyday life an exercise in survival.We will pay special attention to U.S. intervention in Central America, particularly the consequences of its involvement in the military dictatorships and armed conflicts in the region. We'll focus on issues of social trauma and social disaffection, of historical
memory and the genocide of the Mayas, of political resistance and the struggle for social justice, and of the limits of postwar reconstruction and reconciliation in the era of neoliberalism. This course will help us understand the current crisis of Central

What explains divergent voting patterns between Palestinian Christians and Muslims over time? How can we measure inequality between Israeli settlers and Palestinian natives in the West Bank in the present? The course will also synthesize competing theoretical paradigms that account for the enduring nature of this conflict.

",Science Center 102,"(Cross-listed as ENVS 031)The course will examine several ways in which climate change is a driving force of violent and nonviolent conflict and creates opportunities for peacemaking and social justice. Already, climate change has been identified by the U.S. military as a threat to national security, offering a new rationale for expanding the military industrial complex. Demands on scarce resources generate and exacerbate regional conflicts and drive mass movements of refugees. Behind these dramatic manifestations of climate stress lie extensive corporate and national interests and hegemonic silences that emerging conflicts often reveal. Conflict also brings new opportunities for peacebuilding, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Climate crises have renewed and expanded local and global movements for environmental justice and protection, many of which have historical connections with the peace movement. In support of the college's carbon charge initiative, we will dedicate part of the course to understanding what constitutes the social cost of carbon and how it is represented in carbon pricing, particularly with respect to increasing frequencies of armed conflict and extension of the military industrial complex.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

The course will delve into the foundations and history of humanitarianism and track how humanitarian intervention evolved over the course of the 20th century, broadening and deepening in scope. It will explore continuing debates over the appropriateness of education as a humanitarian intervention and examine what types of educational interventions are prioritized by humanitarian agencies, as well as the goals that those interventions are trying to achieve. For example, what is the relationship between education and conflict and how do education in emergencies providers intervene to alter that relationship? Students will have the opportunity to study specific examples of education in emergencies programming in countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, and Syria, and to hear from guest speakers working in the field of education in emergencies.

Just as it is one of the oldest and most complex philosophical puzzles, it also frequently occupies the minds of individuals in their day-to-day lives. In this course, we will focus on both ways of approaching this question. From the philosophical direction, we will discuss the ways in which philosophers have attempted to understand and describe our moral beliefs and commitments. From the practical direction, we will ask ourselves what it means to ascribe to these moral theories and how we might be able to actually live them.PEAC eligible only when taught by PHIL instructor K.

Use of each tool tends to reflect particular views about human nature, capacities, and differences.

In the first part of the course we explore why and how people leave their homes for a different country. We will also consider normative questions around the rights and responsibilities of both host countries and migrants. Do states have the right to close their borders and exclude non-citizens from their territories? Our readings address debates around citizenship, multiculturalism, group membership, and minority rights.  The second part of the course focuses on the dynamics of incorporation: the processes through which immigrant groups settle and integrate in their new country of residence. The growing ethnic, racial, religious, and linguistic diversity generated by immigration has spawned fierce debates over national identity and social cohesion. We will analyze different regimes of political, cultural, and economic integration and ask how states accommodate (and fail to accommodate) ethno-religious minorities by examining struggles over language rights, religious differences, gender and sexuality, and citizenship. Over the course of the semester, students will learn about the politico-economic effects and ideological battles over migration in a number of different countries across the globe.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

",Trotter Hall 303,"If Congress is so widely despised as an institution then what's the point of having it?  Without a representative assembly, to be sure, democracy becomes plebiscitary and juristocratic.  But a well-functioning national legislature is hardly guaranteed because legislatures are inherently unstable - even fluid --- institutions.  Congress today is not the same institution it was a decade ago or a century ago.  With these premises in hand we explore the evolution of the House and the Senate, We also treat the congressional career, majority and minority rights, parties in Congress, House-Senate differences, enactment productivity, political polarization, and gridlock. Other issues include money and interest group influence given sharp ideological polarization (the puzzle here is: how does money matter if members of Congress already have very firm positions?), the committee system, how congressional elections shape the institution, influence on the bureaucracy, presidential influence on the legislative process, congressional interaction with the federal judiciary, and the difficulty of conceptualizing and measuring representation.

We consider how such processes are implemented at the neural level, but also how neural mechanisms help give rise to social and emotional phenomena. Many believe that the expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with others - competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. In this course, we review current theories and methods guiding social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience, taking a multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context.Prerequisite: PSYC 001.","Swarthmore Course Catalog Entry

In turn, it examines how various religious worldviews can aid the development of an earth-centered philosophy of life. The thesis of this course is that the environment crisis, at its core, is a spiritual crisis because it is human beings' deep ecocidal dispositions toward nature that are the cause of the earth's continued degradation. Course topics include ecological thought in Western philosophy, theology, and biblical studies; the role of Asian religious thought in forging an ecological worldview; the value of American nature writings for environmental awareness, including both Euro-American and Amerindian literatures; the public policy debates concerning vegetarianism and the antitoxics movement; and the contemporary relevance of ecofeminism, deep ecology, Neopaganism, and wilderness activism.
