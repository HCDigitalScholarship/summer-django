Now that we have some data to work with, we can start working on a web application.  Flask is one of the simplest Python web frameworks available and has a lot in common with Django.

We'll start by creating a simple "course of the day" application that will randomly pick a course from our dataset.  We're going to publish the application to the web using [sites.haverford.edu](sites.haverford.edu).  If time permits, we can try a more advanced chatbot following this [tutorial](https://pusher.com/tutorials/chatbot-flask-dialogflow).
