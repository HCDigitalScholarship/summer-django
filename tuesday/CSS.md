## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is what makes the web pretty and more usable. It styles web pages so that the same application can be optimized for all devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile, etc.) and applies aesthetic enhancements to pages of otherwise very plain text and images.

CSS rules are written by HTML element or class (we'll get into more case-specific CSS rules later). What do you think the following block does to the display of a web page?

```
p {
  font-family: Roboto;
  font-size: 14px;
  text-align: right;
  text-transform: lowercase;
  }
```
