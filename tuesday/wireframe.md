## Design

### Information architecture

Good design goes far beyond visual style. It's important to consider the _organization_ of your application and its contents as a key component of project design. 

Usability.gov, a web site of the federal government's Department of Health and Human Services, has some good resources on [information architecture](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/information-architecture/index.html), which speaks to the intellectual organization of your site.

### Accessibility

An accessible application is one that can be viewed on a variety of devices, and can accept multiple modes of input (mouse click, keyboard input, touch screen) from users of varying abilities and/or impairments. This means writing in accessible language, clearly structuring pages, designing for colorblind users, avoiding hard-to-read text... the list is long and intimidating. The World Wide Web Consortium has an excellent [accessibility guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/), as well as a [validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/) for checking your site's HTML for basic markers of accessible design. 

### Wireframing 

Wireframing is the practice of designing an application on a basic structural level. Instead of worrying about visual style, typefaces, color combinations, and the like, we concern ourselves primarily with the user experience and the organizational structure of a web application. This practice is common in the early design phase of a project, and can be done with digital wireframing tools or with pencil and paper.
