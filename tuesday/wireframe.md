## Wireframing 

Wireframing is the practice of designing an application on a basic structural level. Instead of worrying about visual style, typefaces, color combinations, and the like, we concern ourselves primarily with the user experience and the organizational structure of a web application. This practice is common in the early design phase of a project, and can be done with digital wireframing tools or with pencil and paper.
